# TextMarkSwitch
Switch
Create a C# program to display the "text mark" corresponding to a certain "numerical mark", using the following equivalence:
* 9,10 = Excellent
* 7,8 = Notable
* 6 = Good
* 5 = Pass
* 0-4 = Fail
Your program must ask the user for a numerical mark and display the corresponding text mark.
You must do it twice: first using “if”and then using “switch”.
